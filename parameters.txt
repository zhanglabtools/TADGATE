# Data input path
# For dense type, input_path should be the root directory of the dense chromatin contact matrix. The dense matrices are named as chr*_dense_matrix.bed, where * represents the chromosome number. Each dense matrix is a non-negative symmetric matrix of size N x N, where N represents bin number.
# For sparse type, input_path should be the root directory of the sparse chromatin contact matrix. The sparse matrices are named as chr*_sparse_matrix.bed, where * represents the chromosome number. Each sparse matrix is a matrix of size N x 3, where N represents bin number, The first two columns represent the indices of the bins, while the third column represents the interaction count between these two bins. 
# For cool、mcool、hic, input_path should be the file name with detailed path.
